                        <p>The American's with Disabilities Act (ADA) gives us certain rights and protections. State laws cannot supersede these protections - they can only add to them, not take anything away. For instance, the ADA does not provide protections or rights to those with Service Dogs in Training, but here in California an owner-trainer or certified trainer working with a Service Dog in Training have the same rights and protections as a handler with a finished service dog.</p>
                        <p>The only way to protect ourselves is to know our rights as defined under the ADA and state law, and to carry information with us to educate the gatekeepers when faced with discrimination. I've found that being low-key about the whole thing makes for a smoother experience, but I have no problem leaving a store that clearly doesn't want my kind or my money in their store and afterwards registering a complaint with the Department of Justice.</p>
                        <p>The following link is for an information sheet that can be printed out and given to gatekeepers to inform them of your rights. I don't leave home without at least a few in my bag: <a href="https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm">ADA Information Sheet</a></p>
                        <p>Here's a link to the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.htm">ADA FAQ</a>. You should be able to find an answer to pretty much any question you have in the FAQ.</p>
                        <p>Now remember, the ADA does not cover air carriers. There is a whole different set of rules for that, and it's called the Air Carrier Access Act. The ACAA doesn't recognize psychiatric service dogs like they do service dogs for the visibly (dis)abled. Instead, they consider psychiatric service dogs to be Emotional Support Animals and you will need all of the paperwork that an ESA requires (stupid, but unfortunately true.) My best advice is to contact whatever airline you plan to fly and see what they require of you, and do that. Also, remember that if you're travelling to Hawaii or overseas, you will need to jump through some hoops to get your dog on the flight and be allowed into the state or country. If you need further help navigating the in's and out's of air travel, feel free to contact me and I will do my best investigating to help you through the process.</p>
