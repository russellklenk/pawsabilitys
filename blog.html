                        <p>So I’ve been on Facebook for about 2 1/2 weeks and I've learned an important lesson - many service dog handlers are jerks. I didn't know that before starting my website or Facebook page. I had only met a few teams and the ones I had encountered were congenial and kind. I suspect that there is a segment of handlers out there that are actually technically fakes. They tend to be mostly psychiatric dog handlers (as much as I hate to admit that) and they are the ones that are the most loud. They scream about their rights and instead of being like a reed bending in the movement of the stream, they rail against anything they see as a slight against them or their rights.</p>
                        <p>There is a reason why Shakespeare wrote “the Lady doth protest too much, methinks.” I’ve said elsewhere on this site that I believe the best way to handle difficulties is with patience and information. I also think its important to remember that kindness is truly the best policy. Except for when my PTSD is acting up or my Autonomic disfunction kicks in and I get nasty. ; ) I make no assumptions about dogs and people I see and I never assume that all dogs are out to get my dog. I certainly don't scream at the top of my lungs about my rights and guess what? I've never had an access issue, even though my dog is still in training. I smile, I say she's a SDiT and I get waved on through. No muss, no fuss. I do carry the ADA fact sheets with me just in case and have only handed out one.</p>
                        <p>This subset of handlers are militant in their opinions and belief that they know all the answers and that they are entitled to film other possible teams they believe to be fakes or dogs that might get them. If anything, they are crippled by their own fears of being caught and discovered for the frauds they really are.</p>
                        <p>I have no interest in representing these types of people. Their voices are loud enough already. So, I may have to rethink my strategy a bit. I will certainly keep up current content and help owner trainers that contact me for help. But I may want to concentrate more on invisible disability awareness as I have found this community to be far more supportive of each other and more deserving of my effort.</p>

		                <p>Ok, after some thought and cooling off I have decided how I plan on refocusing my attentions. While I will aways accept and help people with breeds of all types, I am going to focus on poodles as service dogs and invisibility disability awareness. Bringing attention to service dog handlers that look “normal” but have a disability is where my passion lies (besides poodles, of course) and fighting the stigma of having a fake service dog and being a fake handler team is where its at.</p>
		                <p>So, I guess I made the right choice in naming my website, though it doesn't say anything about disability. I’ll get my intentions out. Hopefully soon we will get involved in some local events that will help us spread the word.  I’ve been trying to get some type of teeshirts and other stuff that others could wear to help get the word out farther. We will see if I can figure it out.</p>

		                <p>So one of the things I have noticed about many of the Facebook handlers is that they seem to have very little knowledge of dog behavior - particularly what sets dogs off. Quick lesson here. A dog can be completely still, but still be the cause of a fight. It's called “the stare” in which a seemingly placid dog stares down another dog often setting the other dog off. The stare is a threat in the dog world, its like a punk kid walking up to another kid and threatening them.</p>
		                <p>It seems the people that have the most problem with this and therefore their dogs getting attacked are owner trainers that have done all the work themselves. At the very least every service dog to be should see a dog behaviorist. This gives the dog training in proper dog etiquette and you information on dog behavior. Its important to remember that your dog may not to be the innocent party in a bad dog interaction.</p>
		                <p>Two well trained service dogs should at most look at each other and give each other the nod. I’m working, you are working, and move on. There should be no looking at each other and certainly no staring. Keep this in mind as you train. Your dog should ignore other dogs to the point of not even looking at each other. Your dogs focus should be on you most of the time (attention does slip at times). Keep up that training and harness your dogs (paws)abilities!</p>

		                <p>So, here is what I think about service dog vests. There are many people that refuse to support ANY website that sells IDs. Now we know the IDs aren't worth the plastic they are printed on, but I couldn't care less. I like to support American companies that make their products here in America (such as the companies listed on my links page) and give back.</p>
		                <p>So, what is the point of this? There are people out there that will tell you you should never get a vest off the internet so you should go to Etsy where people make custom stuff thats really great. Um, isn’t Etsy on the internet? I personally think that the home made vests look unprofessional. At the least get a good service dog cape or vest with standard patches. Nothing naughty or snarky or otherwise offensive.</p>
		                <p>Service dogs should look professional, whether they came from a program or you trained them yourselves. Don't make your dog look like a billboard or a clown. If you wouldn't put it on your wheelchair and go to work, then don't put it on your service dog. Otherwise you just look like a fake - at least in my estimation.</p>

		                <p>Oh boy, here we go. A invisible disability is by its name is obviously <i>invisible</i>. That doesn't mean that these disabled don't need help. Some, like me, choose to use a service dog as part of our treatment plan. We aren't faking anything and the dog is a legitimate part of whatever treatment we are receiving.</p>
		                <p> know dogs are cute, I know they look oh-so-huggable but people need to learn to keep their hands, eyes, smoochy sounds, and distractions to themselves. When I show up for my doctors appointments with my dog, it's not there for the public's enjoyment, it's for my health and well being so just pretend she isn't there. Just because I'm not in a wheelchair doesn't mean she isn't a working dog. I know I'm not the only one with this problem. There seems to be an epidemic of adults that feel entitled to do as they like when it comes to service dogs.</p>
		                <p>Help spread the word, dogs can help those with invisible disabilities - we really exist - and ignoring service dogs is the best policy.</p>

		                <p>So, you remember those Facebook handlers I wrote about before, particularly the ones that liked to film other people? Well apparently one of them got their service dog mauled to death. While I would never laugh at or make light of the death of a dog, particularly a service dog, one has to wonder if this person set himself up for this. I also wonder did he actually get a chance to film the off leash pit bull attacking his dog? Who knows, but let this be a warning to handlers, being an ass towards others serves no purpose, being aware of your surroundings and any dogs in it and removing yourself and your dog from any situation that makes you uncomfortable is the best policy. Yelling fake at every dog you see serves no purpose, but being aware of both dogs arousal levels does. So, get out there, harness your dogs (paws)abilities, but be safe!</p>
