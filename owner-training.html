                        <p>Service dogs are a lot of work, no matter how you get them, so think long and hard before making the commitment. If you go with a program dog, make sure you're up to speed on training and handling BEFORE you get your dog and go through the program training. If you owner-train, that two year waiting period becomes the time you are training. And you will be training. A LOT. Either way, it's very much like having an infant with you at all times. Their needs don't always line up with your desires and when it comes to water, food and potties their needs come first. You have to make sure they don't have an accident indoors. They still need daily walks (unless toy-sized) and all of the regular care that a pet would need, but with extra emphasis on vet care. They also need constant grooming and bathing because they go out in public, so they can't smell or be icky. They require CONSTANT training throughout their lives, so you must be prepared to work with them all the time - even on your days off.</p>
                        <p>I'm not trying to dissuade you from owning a service dog, just to make you aware of the scope of the responsibility. That being said, it was the best decision my husband and I made concerning my (dis)ability, aside from the doctor we chose. We've had highs and lows, training setbacks and amazing training triumphs.</p>

                        <p>Recently, we went on a seven-hour car trip to visit family, and while we were worried that it would be a disaster, it went great. Dash wasn't too happy about being cooped up in the car for so long, but she got some rest when we made it to the hotel. And we got to visit family. It took a ton of planning, potty breaks (where I got a few weird looks about taking a dog into the handicapped stall) and patience.

                        </figure>I didn't have any major issue while there - though I took plenty of time to nap and relax. Also, I added a new tattoo (trust me, you wouldn't think I had any if you met me) that I think is really important and meaningful. I got my poodles and my important messages. My artist said I must get a lot of crap if I'm willing to tattoo it on me, and if you've read the <a href="invisible-disabilities.html">"Invisible (Dis)Abilities"</a> page you know that's the case. But regardless, I love it and the poodles!</p>

                        <p>So, how did this all start? After meeting the most wonderful psychiatrist and coming up with a game plan for my treatment between her, my husband and myself, we decided that a service dog would be a good idea as part of that plan.I began researching service dogs and programs and found two problems. First, almost nobody uses poodles. Second, the few that did either didn't train for what I needed or asked astronomical prices for poodles that looked to be of questionable breeding. Now, I'm not a poodle snob - who are we kidding, of course I am - but I'm not spending $30,000 on a dog of questionable background when I could buy a champion-quality show puppy for that (not that that's what we paid for her as a pet.) My husband and I decided that since we've trained four dogs prior to be good pet dogs and of those, one to be a medic alert dog, we could take on the challenge together and go to the next level. It would take time, money and the help of some great trainers along the way, but our hope was that in the end we would have a well-trained service dog tailored to my specific needs. So, I contacted my breeder, <a href="http://www.mysticalpoodles.com">Marie</a> and told her that I was looking for a very special puppy. 
                        <figure class="leftbar">

                        </figure>
                        A few months later, she contacted me with a puppy she thought would be perfect, as long as I didn't mind her being blue (which in the poodle world means dark grey; it takes them about 2 years to clear to grey from black.) Did I mind? Not a bit. The puppy's personality was what we were looking for. We drove out and picked up Dash, and it's been love ever since, lots of work and frustration, but lots of love.</p>
                        <p>Before Dash, I had Zo&euml; who's a five-pound toy poodle. I carried her in a soft carrier bag when we were out so that she was safe, close to me, and out of people's way. She alerted to oncoming anxiety attacks, interrupted the attacks and provided grounding. She was already a two-year-old, well-trained pet that was insanely smart and insanely easy to train. But I had done this before finding my doctor or knowing what was wrong with me. Once my husband and I understood the enormity of what we were facing, the brutal reality that Zo&euml;, who had served tirelessly for two years, wasn't going to cut it anymore (not if I ever had any hope of any semblance of independence) came crashing down. Fear not, friends, Zo&euml; didn't go anywhere; she still sleeps next to me every night with her head on my pillow and takes over the couch during the day.</p>

                        <h2>Where to start?</h2>
                        <p>Good question! Before we get into types of dogs or personalities, let's talk training equipment. Lots of people think that you put a collar on a dog and attach a leash to the collar and then the puppy will walk. Yeah, no so much... Pulling is a huge problem if you are (dis)abled and don't have the upper body strength for productive corrections, what are you to do? Many positive-only trainers will tell you to use a front-clip harness that yanks the dog around when they pull. Aversive-only trainers will tell you to put a prong collar on your dog - regardless of breed, size or temperament - and yank. The first option only teaches the dog that pulling is no fun on THAT particular harness, and that harness also restricts the forward movement of the dog's legs, possible causing damage. Now, the prong collar - I am not against prongs per-se, but they do not work for all dogs. We took a class with Dash that was a prong class. First off, I learned a ton about training and for that, I'll be forever thankful. But Dash began to resent the collar, and resent me for using it. This is supposed to be a partnership, and in partnerships you have to listen to each other. I finally listened and dumped the collar. Fortunately, at another class the trainer introduced me to the Sense-ible harness. It's a front-clip harness that doesn't impede the dog's movement and does not yank the dog around when it pulls. The front clip portion moves back and forth and pulls gently on the leg pits of the dog, directing it much as the heels of a horseback rider does. The dog doesn't pull simply because there isn't really anything to pull against but themselves. Since I suffer from a lack of upper-body strength, this has been perfect. It doesn't take much for me to control or correct, and I've even been able to work with her on a traditional harness and have her still (generally) be well-behaved and controllable. I now use their Sense-ation harness because it's a bit softer in the girth strap and I hope more comfortable for long periods of work. If you are interested in the harnesses, you can visit the <a href="http://www.softtouchconcepts.com">Soft Touch Concepts</a> web site. Please note that I'm not getting paid to plug any of the products or companies I recommend on my site. They are just things I've used, found work well, and think might be helpful to others.</p>
                        <p>Leashes are important and almost every trainer will tell you that you NEED a six foot leash. It's ridiculous for me to train with a leash longer than I am tall. I mean really? How am I supposed to maintain control of a dog when I'm wrestling with a leash almost a full foot longer than I am tall? If you are tall this isn't a problem, but I found training tabs, 2' traffic leashes, and 4' leashes are the easiest for me to work with. I also have a cross-body leash and a belt leash, but that's another discussion for another time. I love the leashes from <a href="http://www.lupinepet.com">Lupine Pet</a>; they are chew-resistant and guaranteed for life. Your dog will also need a "Service Dog in Training" cape or vest, either of which can be obtained from <a href="http://www.activedogs.com">Active Dogs</a>. The one thing you'll find in common about my product suggestions is that they are all made here in the U.S.A. and all of the companies are supremely easy to work with.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of my research I remember reading or watching YouTube videos about how you will end up with more equipment than you ever believed you would need. I thought I would come up with a game plan and stick with it and not end up with tons of equipment, but nope, they were right; I have enough equipment and leashes for an entire kennel of dogs, but oddly enough I seem to use most of it at least occasionally. So be prepared for buying equipment, and probably a lot more of it than you think you'll need in the beginning.</p>
                        <p>Now to breeds and personalities. First I'm going to start off with something that many people won't like. I would advise against any breed that is seen as an aggressive breed, whether a "bully" breed or a mastiff or whatever. I'm not saying that these dogs can't be great dogs to work with, but they tend to scare the pants off of people and you may have more issues with denial of access because of the way the dog looks. That being said, any dog with the right personality or any dog you are willing to put in the extra time with to make perfect will work. Many people use rescues and they work wonderfully; though I have read that they need more vet care, I'm not sure I'm entirely convinced of that. If looking at a full-grown dog, you want one that is confident but laid back, one that doesn't scare easily and is not aggressive. Most importantly, it should want to please; being food-motivated wouldn't hurt (so she will respond to treats.)</p>
                        <p>Now for the next opinion some people won't like. I know that many out there are of the opinion that adopting is the best way to go, and not buying and I respect that. But we are talking about working dogs, not pets. I believe in researching breeds to see what breed speaks to you and your lifestyle and energy level. I of course suggest poodles, but for good reason. They were bred by the Germans (not the French - they can only claim breeding miniatures down to toys) to be mainly a water retriever, but also an all-around gun dog for hunting. They course, they point, they flush and will enthusiastically jump in a lake. They will do it all. One of our miniatures is a fully trained hunting dog, and she's darn good at it. What all this means is that they bond with a handler very closely, love to have a job, and will work tirelessly. They do require grooming, but you and your house won't be covered in dog hair. Whatever breed you choose, I suggest that you find a good, reputable AKC-recognized breeder. You want a breeder that has a good balance of confirmation wins and agility or working titles. You also want a breeder that you can have a great relationship with. My breeder, <a href="http://www.mysticalpoodles.com">Marie</a> has been an invaluable source of information and puppies. When I needed Dash, I relied on her knowledge and expertise to wait until the right puppy showed up in a litter.</p>
                        <p>So, what is the right puppy? You want the puppy in the litter that is kinda in the middle. Not overly gregarious or outgoing, but not withdrawn and scared; curious about the world but still interested in you. You want a puppy that is biddable, meaning eager to train, and a puppy that wants to work with YOU.</p>
                        <p>Some programs will tell you that owner-trained dogs are not as well trained and that they have a higher wash-out rate. They have the benefit of breeding lots of litters and being able to choose the easiest to work with. We owner-trainers might have to work harder, but that doesn't mean our dogs are any less well-trained and we also have the luxury of working with what a program would consider a wash-out and turning it into a stellar example of a service dog. We also get to tailor the dog's task and work to our specific (dis)abilities. For instance, I have psychiatric (dis)abilities, but I also have some very specific physical (dis)abilities that I need some assistance with. Programs don't generally train for both, but with the help of private trainers and the training I've done, I can get all the tasks I need to lead to a more independent life. And so can you.</p>
                        <h2>How do I begin training?</h2>
                        <p>Once you've found your puppy, where do you begin? Obviously, with potty training. Service dogs must be trained to go on command and not potty inside of a business establishment. We've found that the easiest way to do this is with potty pads, but you can use any method that works for you.</p>
                        <p>Many people will tell you that it's imperative that you take your puppy to puppy kindergarten or on puppy play dates. If you've gone the AKC route, you've just plunked down a not-insubstantial amount of money on a puppy on who's little shoulders are riding a lot of hopes and dreams. I would not take the puppy out on the ground until the round of Parvo vaccines are finished (about four months). This is important because the mortality rate for Parvo in unvaccinated dogs is 91%. It's up to you, but it's a risk I don't take.</p>
                        <p>Besides, there is plenty of training to do during those 2-3 months. There is teaching the basic commands sit, stay, down, leave it and learning to walk on-leash (in the house or your yard, of course.) Also, you want to teach the puppy to calmly lay at your feet. You need these commands to be ingrained in your puppy so they are automatic.</p>
                        <p>Once fully vaccinated for Parvo you can start group obedience classes. If you are in the San Diego area, we use <a href="http://www.aspiredogtraining.com">Aspire Dog Training</a> that I have found to be wonderful to work with. Now, when a dog is trained through a program, all of the the training is certified by the program. As an owner-trainer, this won't be the case. You have to document EVERYTHING. This is how I do it:</p>
                        <figure class="center">
                        	<img src="images/dash_binder.jpg" />
                        	<img src="images/flutter_binder.jpg" />
                        </figure>
                        <p>I use planner-sized binders with calendars to write down the training activity for each day. I also use tabs and paper sleeves so I can keep track of vet records, certificates and registrations, expenses, and my doctor's prescription. Dash's binder, to the left, is larger because she's older and we've gone through way more training. Flutter's binder is to the right and is much smaller because she's only 10 weeks old.</p>
                        <p>Besides written documentation it's a good idea to train for and take the AKC's S.T.A.R. Puppy program as well as their CGC (Canine Good Citizen), CGCA (Canine Good Citizen - Community Canine) and CGCU (Canine Good Citizen - Urban). These cost money ($10-$20 apiece) but are recorded with the AKC as titles and are proof of training. So, it's a good idea to think about completing these programs.</p>
                        <p>Group obedience classes can last for a year to a year and a half. During this time, basic task training - the stuff you feel you can do - can take place. If there are tasks you feel you can't train on your own, you can go to a private trainer once obedience is solid. Try to find a private trainer with service dog experience, explain to them what tasks need to be trained, and let them help you come up with a game plan for getting there. Remember, if your state allows for it, you should be taking your dog everywhere with you starting as soon as their rabies vaccination is complete. Make sure they have an "in training" cape or vest and always be on top of their obedience. Also, remember that service dogs should not react to other dogs or try to seek attention from other people.</p>
