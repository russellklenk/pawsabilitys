            <p class="lead">A place for information and resources for owner training service dogs, invisible (dis)abilities, and of course poodles!</p>
            <p>This is a place primarily for information and education. Since I began my "descent" into (dis)ability and coming to terms with reality I've had one fully-trained service dog and am now training my second. This website comes partly from the discrimination and indignation I've experienced from having poodles as service dogs.</p>
            <p>My first dog was needed for medic alert only and is a wonderful and marvelously intelligent five pound toy poodle. She was carried around in a carrier so she could keep an eye on me and to keep her out of other people's way. Oh, the looks I got for bringing in my "foo foo" dog that was obviously a "pet". What good could such a small dog possibly do? Besides, I look able-bodied, right?</p>
            <p>Zo&euml; (the toy poodle) wasn't retired because of age or disease, in fact she is still very much young and bossing me around the house. It came down to the simple fact that my (dis)abilities were outstripping her ability to fully help me, so we decided we needed to move me up to a standard poodle. So, now I have Dash who is under a year old and kicking butt and taking names in obedience and public access training. But I still get stares and the not-so-quiet behind the back comments that I am a faker because poodles can't be service dogs. And I look able-bodied, right?</p>
            <p>Why poodles, you ask? The answer is simple - I'm allergic to almost all dogs (including doodles) - but not poodles. Once the site launches, I'll go into greater detail about this wonderful breed and the wonderful breeder (who breeds some of the U.S.'s best poodles) I've gotten all of my dogs from.</p>
            <p>Check back over the coming weeks for the site launch, where I'll share my experiences in owner training service dogs, living with invisible (dis)abilities, and provide resources you can use in your own adventures!</p>
