                        <p>First, a note about my spelling of disability. I spell it, obviously, with parentheses around the dis- prefix because it has a very negative connotation. Here's the definition of the prefix from <a href="<http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dis-?s=t">dictionary.com</a>:</p>

                        </figure>
                        <figure>
                        <figcaption class="quote">a Latin prefix meaning "apart," "asunder," "away," "utterly," or having a privative, negative, or reversing force (see de-, un-2.); used freely, especially with these latter senses, as an English formative: <i>disability; disaffirm; disbar; disbelief; discontent; dishearten; dislike; disown.</i></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>As you can see, saying dis-abled is about the same as saying un-abled. Both mean that we are somehow less than "able" people. Just because we have challenges, both large and small, doesn't mean we aren't ABLE at all or our value is less than that of any other person. We are humans and I demand that we be treated like people like everyone else, and not oddities or curiosities. When I'm out with my dog on a bad day, I'm not something to be pointed and stared at or spoken about behind my back. Like everyone else, I'd like to run my errands and live my life. So, maybe I need a bit of help to do it, big deal. So, that's that!</p>
                        <p>Invisible (dis)abilities come in so many forms, there are almost too many to list. There are mental or psychiatric (dis)abilities that can be either a chronic illness or a physical or physiological abnormality.</p>
                        <p>Many of us use service dogs or other assistive aids to help us get through the day. Canes and walkers bring pity, but dogs bring scorn. Neither of these are okay. All bring the statement "but you look healthy, what's wrong with you?" Which, of course, is the able-bodied equivalent of asking for someone's medical records, which no one would ever do. We don't owe anyone an explanation for our existence - or our dogs. All we owe is the answers to the two ADA-approved questions posed to us by the Gatekeepers. We own nothing to anyone else.</p>
                        <p>All this being said, I try to be as polite as possible with people's intrusive questions. Sometimes I'm just vague, not because I'm faking, but it's really none of their business and I might be having a bad day. On better days I might go into more detail. Sometimes I'll tolerate the endless dumb questions about my dog, sometimes I answer a few quick questions and then leave.</p>
                        <p>But, all of this brings me around to the original point. We aren't side shows, we aren't less-than, and we deserve to be treated like actual people.</p>
